# houseplants-project

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I created a Houseplants landing page 
as my final project in my SheCodes Basics - Introduction to Coding certification. 
My landing page discusses some of the many benefits of houseplants and includes links to external articles to learn more about houseplants and the care they need.
I also created a button, that when clicked, allows you to sign up with your email to receive imaginary special offers and a weekly houseplant newsletter to learn more about houseplants, plant care, & incorporating plants into your home decor.
